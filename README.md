# Rock Paper Scissors Multiplayer Game

## Overview

In this project, an online multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game is created with the help of Firebase (and the rest of the web development repertoire - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery etc)!

## Setup

* Create a GitHub repo called RPS-Multiplayer and clone it to the computer.

* Create a file inside of the RPS-Multiplayer folder called ```index.html```. This is where the page's HTML goes.

* Include jQuery and Firebase.

* Inside RPS-Multiplayer, create the assets directory.

* Inside the assets folders create the css, images and js folders
  * Inside the css folder create ```style.css``` file
  * Inside the js folder, create ```app.js
  * Inside the images folder, place the ```rps.jpg``` file

## How the game works

* The game is created so that it suits this user story:

  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. 

  * After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Some chat functionality is created here to enable the ususal taunts and insults from jerk opponents
